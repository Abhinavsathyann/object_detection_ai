![Object Detection](assets/preview.png)

## Overview
This is an **advanced real-time object detection application** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **YOLOv3-tiny / YOLOv3**.  
It features a **user-friendly GUI**, **animations for detected objects**, and **robust error handling** for smooth webcam-based detection.

The application supports:  
- YOLOv3-tiny for **lightweight, fast detection**  
- YOLOv3 for **high-accuracy detection**  
- Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to remove duplicate boxes  
- Dynamic confidence threshold and customizable class colors

## Features

- Real-time object detection with webcam feed  
- Friendly GUI interface using **Tkinter + TTKThemes**  
- Handles empty frames and missing detections gracefully  
- Optimized for **CPU and GPU acceleration**  
- Supports multiple object classes (COCO dataset)  
- Adjustable confidence and NMS thresholds for performance tuning
